# drill app

drill app is an application that aims to solve the problem of unpreparedness for disasters and to help people after disasters. Currently, the application is focused mainly on earthquakes, but in the future, it will also include other types of disasters. The app aims to provide solutions for two of the United Nations' 17 sustainable development goals, which are Sustainable Cities and Communities (Goal 11) and Climate Action (Goal 13).

With our application, you can track the latest earthquakes, easily share your address information if you have been affected by an earthquake, create drill to prepare for earthquakes and you can find potential life triangles in your living area. Additionally, the app contains informative articles and quizzes related to natural disasters. If we can create awareness about disasters, the number of casualties can be significantly reduced. Therefore, be prepared for disasters with our app.

## Feedbacks

- [@CeRBeR666](https://github.com/CeRBeR666) : A control algorithm is required when tweeting to prevent unnecessary use. Apart from these, the design of the application is quite good. I look forward to the next versions of the application.
